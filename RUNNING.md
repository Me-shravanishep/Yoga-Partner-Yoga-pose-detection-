# ‚úÖ APPLICATION IS NOW RUNNING!

## üéâ Success - Your Flask App is Live!

Your Yoga Pose Detection web app is now running at:
- **Local URL:** http://127.0.0.1:5000
- **Network URL:** http://10.230.226.104:5000

The Simple Browser should have opened automatically in VS Code showing your app!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note - MediaPipe Limitation

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Flask server: **RUNNING**
- ‚úÖ OpenCV: **INSTALLED** (version 4.12.0.88)
- ‚úÖ NumPy: **INSTALLED** (version 2.2.6)
- ‚úÖ Camera feed: **WORKING**
- ‚ùå MediaPipe: **NOT AVAILABLE** (requires Python 3.10 or 3.11)

**Why MediaPipe isn't installed:**
You're using Python 3.13, but MediaPipe only has prebuilt wheels for Python 3.10 and 3.11.

---

## üéØ What's Working Right Now

### ‚úÖ Features Currently Available:

1. **Web Server** - Flask is serving your web app
2. **Camera Access** - OpenCV can capture webcam frames
3. **Video Streaming** - Live camera feed in browser (without pose detection)
4. **User Registration** - Save user data to JSON files
5. **Health Check** - API endpoint shows library versions
6. **Responsive UI** - Beautiful interface with gradient design

### ‚ùå Not Yet Available:

1. **Pose Detection** - MediaPipe skeleton overlay (needs Python 3.11)
2. **Landmark Extraction** - 33 body keypoints
3. **Pose Classification** - Yoga pose recognition

---

## üîß To Enable Full Pose Detection (MediaPipe)

You have 3 options:

### Option 1: Install Python 3.11 (Recommended)

1. **Download Python 3.11:**
   - Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.11.x (latest 3.11 version)
   - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

2. **Create New Environment with Python 3.11:**
   ```powershell
   # Stop current server first (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   
   # Remove old venv
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force venv
   
   # Create new venv with Python 3.11
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate it
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Install all dependencies (including MediaPipe)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run the full app
   python app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use Anaconda/Miniconda

```powershell
# Install Miniconda from: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

# Create conda environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n yoga python=3.11
conda activate yoga

# Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\shrav\OneDrive\Desktop\YOGA POSE DETECTION\Yoga-Partner-Yoga-pose-detection-"

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run app
python app.py
```

### Option 3: Use Docker (Advanced)

Create a Dockerfile with Python 3.11 base image.

## üéì What to Do Next (Learning Path)

### Right Now (with current setup):
1. **Explore the UI** - See how Flask serves templates
2. **Check the camera feed** - Understand OpenCV video streaming
3. **Test user registration** - See JSON data persistence
4. **Read the code:**
   - `app_demo.py` - Current working version
   - `templates/index.html` - Frontend structure
   - `static/js/main.js` - JavaScript logic
   - `static/css/style.css` - Styling

### After Installing Python 3.11:
1. Install MediaPipe
2. Run full `app.py` with pose detection
3. Study `models/pose_detector.py`
4. Experiment with pose classification
5. Add new yoga poses
6. Implement accuracy scoring

## üõë How to Stop the Server

In the terminal where Flask is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera not showing?
- Check if another app is using the camera
- Grant camera permissions in Windows Settings
- Try different camera index: change `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

### Port 5000 already in use?
```powershell
# Change port in app_demo.py last line:
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Use 5001 instead
```

### Can't activate venv?
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
